    "Andy Warhol designed the album cover for The Velvet Underground & Nico, the debut album by the American rock band the Velvet Underground, released in March 1967 by Verve Records. The cover features a yellow banana sticker that can be peeled off to reveal a pink banana underneath. The design was innovative and interactive, reflecting the band's avant-garde style and Warhol's pop art aesthetic.",
